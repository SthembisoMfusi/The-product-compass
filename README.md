# The-product-compass
A Python and Node.js-based e-commerce application that leverages Google's BigQuery to provide intelligent, semantic product recommendations. This project moves beyond simple category-based suggestions by using vector embeddings and vector search to find functionally and stylistically similar substitute products when an item is out of stock.
